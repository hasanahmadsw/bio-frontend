- Software System
- The Good Software
- Software Engineering
- Software Development Life Cycle

### Software System

A software is the programs with data and documentation, and we do not mean here to
document the comments between the lines of the program.
Documenting all the steps we are talking to develop any software system at all stages of
analysis, design, implementation and testing.
It is mainly divided into two types:

#### - Generic Software:

Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to
buy them.

#### - Customized Software:

Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.

### The Good Software

Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user
and should be maintainable, dependable and usable.

#### Dependency:

1. Security.
2. Availability.
3. Reliability.
4. Safety.

### Software Engineering:

Software engineering means building a new product or systems or modifying and
developing old system and improving their mistakes, as well as finding problems that
already exist.

#### The fundamental software engineering activities:

1. Analysis.
2. Design.
3. Implementation.
4. Testing.
5. Maintenance.

These activities are called the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

#### Analysis:

It means what the system is required to do, or what services the system provides, and this is what we know from the stakeholders.
They are persons or institutions represented by persons who directly or indirectly influence or influence the system.

After the problem identification process, we identify the stakeholders and then collect the system requirements.
After the process of collecting the requirements, we analyze and classify them in agreement with the stakeholders and this is called a characterization or analysis.

#### Desgin:

At this stage, we move from the stage of what is required of the system to the stage of achieving what is this system is required.

- System architecture.
- Desgin Algorithms.
- Desgin Databases and Diagram.
- Design User Interfaces.

#### Implementation:

At this stage, the programmer writes the algorithms designed by the designer and converts them into
software code.

#### Testing:

The stage of testing the system and discovering errors.

#### Maintenance:

The stage of updating system features and fixing errors that may occur in the future.

### Conclusion

The software industry is a very broad field that no one can fully master, and it is not only limited to writing code, but writing code is a small stage of this process.
